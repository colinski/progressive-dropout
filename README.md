# Progressive Dropout
<img src="./channels.png" width="1080px"></img>

The Progressive Dropout layer sets entire feature maps to zero, progressing from left to right. This strategy encourages a model to learn a set of maps that are sorted by importance, from left to right. This approach facilitates the transmission of partial feature representations over a network with minimal performance loss, thereby saving on communication costs.
